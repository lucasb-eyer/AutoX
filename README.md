AutoX
=====

Automation of user input for X11 (Linux).

It is not intended to be compatible to AutoHotkey in any way (yet) as I don't
feel like it. This tool currently is *very primitive* and might or might not
evolve to a fully-fledged automation tool, depending on my needs and time.

Still, if you have any request, feel free to open an issue for discussion or
even submit a PR!
