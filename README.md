AutoX
=====

Automation of user input for X11 (Linux).

It is not intended to be compatible to AutoHotkey in any way (yet) as I don't
feel like it. This tool currently is *very primitive* and might or might not
evolve to a fully-fledged automation tool, depending on my needs and time.

Still, if you have any request, feel free to open an issue for discussion or
even submit a PR!

xdotool
=======

After having started this, I found out about [xdotool](http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool),
which does pretty much what I need, is more complete, and has a very [clean codebase](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool).
The problem is, it doesn't seem to work reliably for me, though according to
the number of people using that tool, it seems I'm doing something wrong.
